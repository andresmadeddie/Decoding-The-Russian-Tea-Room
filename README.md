This project is about locating and decoding data in a forensic image to obtain the missing data. To Assemble the data is required to understand concepts related to encoding and decoding as Unicode, big endian, little endian, UTF-8, UTF-16, BOM, Cyrillic, Latin, etc. In cybersecurity, locating, identifying, encoding, and decoding skills also are used with other types of data such as executable code or malicious documents. The project's report lies in the Russian Tea Room file.


## The Narrative behind the project

There was a fire at the Little Russian Tea Room restaurant last week, and the only thing recovered was a hard drive. To start rebuilding the business, the restaurant hired you as a forensics investigator to look at the disk image and reconstruct the menu. You'll be working with an EnCase image of the hard drive. Luckily, the English and Russian menu are both in the hard drive image. However, only the English menu and two sections of the Russian menu are readable. Your must decode several sections of the Russian menu.
